Reseller advice: Before selling, test the unit thoroughly to ensure it can reach and hold a temperature of 40\u00b0F or lower. If it can, the value could increase.

        "reasoning": "The valuation is based on sold listings for the exact TurboChef NGO model. The clear image of the data plate, confirming the model and 2014 manufacture date, is a significant asset. The price is adjusted for its age and the need for a thorough cleaning. Expert advice: TurboChef ovens are in high demand from cafes and quick-service restaurants. A deep cleaning of the interior and exterior would significantly improve its appeal and could increase the final sale price. Despite being a 'countertop' model, it is heavy and should be shipped via freight. I analyzed 7 images for this item.",

One burner has a chipped glass top, and a control panel displays an 'E0' error code. This indicates a potential fault. The unit must be sold for parts or repair. Expert advice: The 'E0' error on induction cooktops can sometimes mean 'no pan detected.' Test with a proper induction pan. If the error persists, it's faulty. Be transparent about the chip and the error code in any resale listing to prevent returns. The value is based on its potential use for its three remaining good burners and other parts.
