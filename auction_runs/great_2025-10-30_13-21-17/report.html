Value is modest and depends on size and the integrity of its delicate spines, which appear to be in good condition here. Reseller advice: These are extremely fragile. Shipping requires double-boxing and using soft packing material like poly-fill to individually cushion the spines to prevent breakage, which would destroy its value. Emphasize 'All Spines Intact' in the title. This is a natural item with no manufacturing year. I analyzed 4 images.",
