The box graphics and components are highly sought after by vintage game collectors. The small Parcheesi set adds minor value. Reseller tip: The absolute most important selling point is completeness. Inventory every single piece (heads, bodies, legs, eyes, etc.) against the instructions and state clearly '100% Complete' if it is. This can double the value compared to an unchecked one. Estimated manufacturing year is 1949-1950s. Analyzed 8 images.",

The condition appears to be excellent, with bright, clean lithography. The lack of a box keeps the value from being higher, but it's still a strong piece on its own. Reseller advice: The action for this toy involves walking and ringing the bell. Test this and film a video for the listing. The felt on the bottom of the feet is an original detail; its presence indicates the toy has been well cared for and not heavily played with. Mention this in the description.

Reseller advice: To maximize value, create a short video showing the typewriter in action. This proves functionality and can add $50+ to the final price.

This brand made plush for carnivals and store displays, which have a strong collector following. The size and retro 80s aesthetic make it a desirable piece. The smaller bunny adds minimal value.
