The crown jewel is the Deluxe Headless Horseman box set, which commands a high price on its own. Having the other main figures from the series, all sealed and in good condition, makes this a very attractive package for collectors. Reseller advice: Sell this as a complete series lot, as it will attract serious collectors and command a premium price over selling individually. Time your listing for September/October to capitalize on Halloween-season interest. Estimated manufacture year: 1999. I analyzed 15 images.",
