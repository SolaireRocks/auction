        "reasoning": "This is a generic, unbranded hand truck. Its value is purely utilitarian. The added hooks give it some niche utility for moving items like stacked chairs or certain equipment, which slightly increases its value over a basic dolly. However, as a local pickup item without a brand, its value is limited to what someone would pay for a basic used tool. Expert tip: Check the tires. If they are 'flat-free' solid tires, mention that in the listing as it's a desirable feature. Estimated manufacturing year: 2000s. Analyzed 2 images.",
