Without stated length or original packaging, I valued the pair at $700 in tested/working condition. Tips: measure and list exact length, show both ends and the impedance switches, and note channel labels (red/blue). Include continuity test results; original box and documentation can add 5\u201310%.

With no photos, length, or termination provided, I priced conservatively at $350 for a working, standard-length pair. Pro tip: add exact length tip-to-tip, termination type, close-ups of the network modules/labels, and continuity test results; also clarify whether the model is S3.3 or S33 as both appear in the listing. Including original packaging or pouches can add value and buyer confidence. Images analyzed: 0.",
