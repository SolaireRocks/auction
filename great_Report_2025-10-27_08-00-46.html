It can be shipped, but requires careful handling and packaging due to size and the fragile shade. Expert advice: The large cylindrical shade is very susceptible to damage; if shipping, confirm it can be packaged separately in a rigid box, or opt for local pickup only if concerned about freight costs and damage. Based on the ornate style, I estimate this was made in the 1960s or 1970s. I analyzed 3 images.",

The total valuation reflects the low market value for these types of collectibles.

Expert advice: Be extremely careful when handling and packing chalkware. It is very brittle and chips easily.

They are not considered highly collectible in the same vein as brands like Lladro or Hummel. The value is purely decorative and quite low. The winter/holiday theme gives it some seasonal appeal, which is the best angle for marketing it. It should be listed in the fall for the holiday season. It was likely made in the 1990s.

Its large size and fragility make it unshippable via standard carriers, limiting the market to local pickup or buyers willing to arrange freight. The wiring appears to have been updated, which is a major selling point for safety. Expert tip: replace the modern round bulbs with decorative Edison-style filament bulbs to dramatically increase its visual appeal and perceived value for photos and sale.

Expert Advice: Always specify the dimensions of large tabletop games.

While the themes (Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind) are popular, the plates themselves typically sell for $3-$5 each, and are difficult to move. The value here is for the entire box as a bulk lot. An expert tip is to market these to crafters who use them for mosaics or tiered cake stands rather than to collectors. These were likely made in the late 1980s or early 1990s. I analyzed 2 images.",
