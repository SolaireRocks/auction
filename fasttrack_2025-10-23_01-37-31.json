        "reasoning": "Analyzed 7 images. This is a high-value commercial rapid cook oven, identified by the data plate as Model NGO (manufactured 2014). Used TurboChef units, despite their age, typically retain significant value, trading between $1,500 and $3,500. I valued it at $2,200, accounting for the visible grime/wear requiring a deep professional cleaning (seen in the internal photos) and the necessary functional testing. Expert advice: To maximize value, buyers must verify operational efficiency. Clearly list the high voltage requirements (208/240V, 30 Amps). Due to its weight and special power needs, shipping this unit often requires specialized handling or LTL freight, preventing standard parcel shipping.",

        "reasoning": "Analyzed 6 images. This is a TableCraft 4-burner commercial induction cooktop unit. New units typically cost $1,000 to $2,500. However, image analysis clearly shows chipping/damage on one of the Schott Ceran glass surfaces (Image 5). This type of damage significantly reduces the resale value and may compromise future safety or functionality, necessitating a steep discount. I valued it at $550, assuming the other three burners are fully functional. Expert advice: While the listing claims it is working, the error code 'E0' visible in one photo usually indicates that no induction-compatible pot is present, but this must be confirmed. Due to the large size and fragile nature of the glass cooktop, shipping is risky and likely requires special handling, making 'false' the appropriate shippability classification.",
