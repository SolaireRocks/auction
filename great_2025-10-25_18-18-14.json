None of the items are particularly valuable on their own. The best strategy is to sell them as a single lot. The valuation reflects the low demand for this style of decor. Expert advice: The fan-shaped holder is the most interesting piece. It could be marketed as a 'Boho' or 'Eclectic' card or jewelry display to appeal to current trends.

The value is based on comparable sales of similar large, unmarked Staffordshire bowls. Expert advice: a reseller should use Google Lens on the maker's mark to try and identify the specific pottery, as some makers like Spode or Wedgwood would command a higher price. This bowl likely dates to the mid-20th century. I analyzed 4 images.",

The value is driven by the brand reputation, the ornate and uncommon Rococo-style cabinet, and the excellent high-gloss mahogany finish. There appears to be wiring underneath, suggesting a player system (like PianoDisc) may be installed, which could add thousands to the value if functional. The valuation is conservative as the model, serial number, and status of the player system are unknown. A professional inspection is recommended. Expert tip: Market this piano not only to musicians but also to interior designers due to its statement furniture quality. I believe this piano was made in the 1990s. I analyzed 12 images.",

Its value lies in its nostalgic and stylistic appeal to collectors of Postmodern or '80s decor. It is not fine art and has no known artist, limiting its value. Expert tip: Marketing this with keywords like '80s', 'Postmodern', 'Memphis Style', and 'Miami Vice' will target the correct niche audience. I estimate this was made in the late 1980s.

They are bulky and difficult to ship, making them suitable only for local sale (flea market, garage sale). The embossed metal planters might have some value on their own if the flowers are removed. Reseller tip: Sometimes the containers are more valuable than the arrangement. If you get lots like this for cheap, consider pulling out the old florals and selling the planters or vases separately. I believe this was made in the 1990s. I analyzed 3 images.",
